#### ðŸš¨ A Rant About the Windows Native API ðŸš¨ ####
# WHY, MICROSOFT?!
# Why do you keep creating things that could be great,
# only to mess them up later?! Why do you insist on hiding
# information from users and effectively lying to them?
# Take this ridiculous mess, for example:
# You'd think retrieving a user's real name would be simple, right?
# Well, it kinda works - until the user changes their username. 
# That's when everything falls apart.
# See, Windows maintains two different names:
# - The original username (the one used internally for system paths, permissions, and authentication).
# - The display name (the one you see on the login screen).
# When a user changes their username in Settings, Windows only updates the display name,
# not the real one. So when a program (like this one) tries to
# retrieve the system username, it gets the original name instead of the one the user expects.
# This is why, in Doki Doki Literature Club!, Monika - thinking sheâ€™s clever - reads
# the system username, assuming it's your real name.
# But if your original username was "Admin" or "Bob",
# well... guess what? That's what Monika calls you.
# And now she just looks dumb.
# It's a missed opportunity - the effect could have been way cooler
# if Windows actually returned the correct name.
# Instead, Microsoft decided to gaslight both Monika and the player.
# Now contrast this with Unix/Linux, where everything is beautifully simple:
# Your system username is stored in /etc/passwd, a plain text file.
# Programs can just read it, split a line by ':',
# and grab the real user name - no syscalls, no nonsense.
# Compare that to Windows, where you need to import ctypes, handle DWORDs, manage buffers,
# and pray to the Microsoft gods that it returns the right value.
# Windows, you could have made this simpleâ€¦ but you just had to make it complicated.
# Sigh...
# Thanks for yet again not trusting your users, Microsoft! ðŸ™ƒ
