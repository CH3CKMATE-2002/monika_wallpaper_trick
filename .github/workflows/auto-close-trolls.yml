But you see, I'm always watching over this repository. ðŸ’š Andreas works really hard on this, so I can't just let *anyone* mess with it! If you want to contribute, make sure it's something *meaningful*, okay? Otherwise... well, I'll just have to close your PR. And look at that! It's already done! Ahaha~! ðŸ˜† Come back when you have *real* changes to make! I'll be waiting~"
